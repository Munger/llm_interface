# Future implementation note:
# This module will be implemented using the Paramiko library for SSH functionality.
# The actual implementation will include:
# - Proper connection handling with Paramiko
# - Command execution with streaming output
# - File transfer capabilities
# - Session management
# - Security considerations for sandbox VM access
